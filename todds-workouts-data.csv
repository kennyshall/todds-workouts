B Rower and push up ladder!:
row 500 meters with push ups!

you will row 500 meters in 1:58-2:00 pace
followed by 5 push ups
rest 2 mins
move into set 2
which is 500 meter row in 156-158 pace
followed by 10 push ups
rest 2 mins
move into set 3 
which is 500 meter row in 154:-156 pace
followed by 15 push ups
follow this format of lowering the pace by 2 seconds for the 500 and adding 5 push ups until you fail at the push ups unbroken or meeting the row in the time frame
Results: Made it to the 7th round
1:59.5 500 pace - 5 push ups 
1:57.5 - 10
1:55.8 - 15
1:53.6 - 20
1:51.6 - 25
1:49.6 - 30
1:47.9 - 21

Assuming unbroken push ups means that you don’t stop in the middle to catch a break. Unbroken is straight through, up and down. I didn’t stop at all, failed at 21 of 35.

Results: I’ve been having groin pain again (hernia area) I didn’t want to do all three and now know what is aggravating it. I will do this one, preferably on another day

","Todd Roselle: All things considered I believe my fitness is way down. These numbers say it’s down, but not as far as I thought it was. Not bad. 

Would like to improve these. I feel like that 2k is the best barometer to tell me how fit i am at any time. Def lower than I want.
Todd Roselle: Done at 66 in garage at 6:45a
Jud Dean: Looking at the adherence numbers and the travel you definitely have room to lock in more and improve it. As it always comes down to priorities and how bad we want to see numbers improve. 

You have said you are not taking the supplement support suggested and I don’t know about how much you have been following the old meal plan we had suggested. If you have not been doing those maybe a place to start as well 

But simply from the workout lens 
Adherence per your true coach is 

Last 30 days 61%
Last 90 days 72%

So looking at those alone I can say the few people we still do program work for the improvement normally doesn’t happen when this is below 95%
And for best results diet lifestyle have to be locked in as well

Have an awesome holiday weekend
Todd Roselle: Unfortunately, I have more travel coming. I do plan to lock in more. Some of the problem with the adherence has been the pain i've had of late in the groin. I just haven't been able to do certain things and I've done my best to work around them. I scheduled an appointment w the cleveland clinic (supposed experts on nerve entrapment via inguinal hernias). Hopefully relief is on the way.

Body composition looks pretty good. Food has been good, nearly no alcohol (maybe a drink or 2 a month). And I do want to ramp things back up. Always appreciate the communication and honesty. I do want to dial in here moving forward with the hope of becoming more fit. 

I've noticed an unexplained drop in HRV which i mentioned to you before and I've been digging for answers. I've seen a cardiologist, I have another scan coming up and nothing is showing as a problem. (I think) That narrows it down to the nerve entrapment, stress, and mentally being not all in for the fear of the loss of fitness being a bigger problem).

Looking forward to our chat. have a great weekend.
Jud Dean: You bet pal!"

Pick one, do it 4 times for one round, then pick a different one for the next round to do 4x etc?

Jud Dean: Man bummer even this is effecting the trap need to go to no push up burpee then and do those 2 weeks just lower body and cardio and core and see if that helps it calm down

Always say longer than 2 weeks of something lingering if you take rest and get treatment is overall body inflammation
Todd Roselle: This one was ok. The other ones from Saturday and Monday I was unable to do, the cleans and dead lifts etc. The burpee was ok here.
Jud Dean: Any other higher volume effecting it 

I always say when something lingers longer than 14 days it’s smart to give it those 2 weeks off and see from there 

Obviously if you did murph or something that amount of volume on a area that is already having issues is going to flare it 


If after 2 weeks of the new program does not release it I would then look deeper into overall inflammation vs just the acute workout being the driver
Todd Roselle: No real Murph for me. Just running and squats. That volume is way too much at my age (especially with compromised limbs). I was planning to do the regular Saturday workout that was programmed, but too much of it was too hard on my back and left forearm/bicep. 

Pull ups have always hurt my biceps. I know better!

Jud Dean: Yeah man stay pain free if you don’t plan to do those events with high volume pulls kippimf and things like that are not needed. Can do strict even banded or lay pull downs ring rows or Bulgarian ring row instead to make it strength focused
Todd Roselle: I backed out of the Dewey comp. Just not there.
Jud Dean: Have to really want to hit that effort with locked in mindset 

So if balance of life is not there not worth it my man!

Have to keep the balance 
Dad, work, health, leisure, desire of goals, husband role and then the athlete role requires those other hats to take a little more of a back burner. And to do it at highest level a lot more back burner so train enjoy summer and can always pick an event later down the road when the time is right if you desire
Todd Roselle: Considering how difficult (and demoralizing) it’s becoming to stay healthy enough to be at the level I want, I’m thinking I want to make sure I keep my cardiovascular capacity and sacrifice a little on the competitive side. I’m thinking a target weight of 170/172 and high cardio capacity would be the new ‘goal’. Maybe even see some real abs for once. 

BRW, how’s your cholesterol these days just curious. I’m feeling sluggish and wondering if that might have something to do w it for me.
Jud Dean: Can definitely work on the engine side of the programming for you no problem! Will work on that this weekend so you will see some changes on that side for sure!

Anytime you want to look at deeper labs we can always do that! From hormones to heart health and always gut health!

I know we sent over that meal plan for you and suggestions on support so if you have not been on that always a good place to start!

Todd Roselle: Groin has been ok because of the rest from illness. It's def something that gets activated and aggravated when i work out. It's just chronic pain. had another CT scan and as of now, no hernia, don't believe there's anything that showed up. Wondering if there is a nerve that got disturbed during the appendectomy that has just been effed up since. i felt the pain as soon as i got off the table that day and it's never gone away.

Of the things on old labs you could work on to improve hrv would be making sure you are getting the ultra vit in and the immune charge as there are more and more studies showing low b vit and low d can link wi to hrv and you did have low vit d to know all the b”s would have to test but that is one to work on getting up

Jud Dean: If you desire to avoid the dynamic upper body things I can surely program that way I thought you had a Comp in November to prep for. Let me know how to best serve you as that section is designed to be dynamic which would build anerpibic capacity so if not able or wanting to do the dynamic pulls we would need to put some other tool into that workout to get the right dose response to build anerobic capacity
Todd Roselle: Sounds good. I have been feeling better, but don't think my shoulder is ready for it yet. I""m thinking i avoid it until the comp, unless youthink we should work somethign in before hand so it's not too much the day of.
Jud Dean: you may be really sore the day or so after as you jsut will not know. its just a lot to go dynamic on a joint when it has not done it for a long time so just be smart. its like a pitcher not throwing hard and then asking the arm to throw hard game day. its a partner comp so often in those you kind navifate and avoid more than individual"

Todd Roselle: Good call. Shoulder is still tender, not as bad but I still feel it. Excited to get going again. Feeling things start to come together. And Fuck it’s so much harder as we age.
Jud Dean: just have to be more detailed in the planning as we age. like me having to start investing later than what would have been perfect world haha

 just have to be more dialed in. at 20 you can have a cheat meal here and there you can stay up later have a drink or 2, as you age no so much 100% adherence to get the desired outcome. all the little things become bigger things with each passing year."

Def have to just eat the very low reactive food and any time a comp is done and sickness inflammation is going to go very high so recovery is going to be hindered 

Let me know which you would prefer full deload or a contrast style of training 

Contrast would be bodybuilding style or all light aerobic and sauna mobility style 

Your pick
Todd Roselle: I would say contrast. I hate, not moving. Thanks brother
Jud Dean: Which style of contrast would you prefer on how you are feeling 

Body building or aerobic work with the sauna 

Aerobic work with sauna if your joints/muscles are hurting a lot would be my suggestion

"Thursday, May 12th, 2022",Completed,Vitamin D does a lot,"A Vitamin D does a lot:
Vitamin D is known for its immune support but two ways it does that are it regulates intestinal permeability (leaky gut) and Brain Detoxification. This is huge for longevity. Supplementation maybe needed but sunlight is a great way to increase it as well. Sunlight exposure boosts Vitamin D, Serotonin, and BDNF (in that order). So, it makes you healthier and happier. 
Low Vitamin D has been linked to:
Mental illness 
Neurodenegeration 
Cancer
IBS/IBD
Infections
Autoimmune
Diabetes
Arthritis 
Periodontal Disease 
Skin Disorders
and more
Knowing your Vitamin D levels and why they
may be low is an important marker for your health. 

Overall body health starts with Gut Health and Brain Health and vitamin D plays a key role in both.
The Intestinal Barrier is composed of many tight junctions made up of proteins. Vitamin D has been shown to regulate the expression of these proteins and maintain a healthy gut wall that protects us from leaky gut and systemic immune changes. It does the same action in the Blood Brain Barrier preventing you from getting leaky brain. The Brain must detox similar to the liver and how it detoxes the body. Vitamin D up regulates proteins in the brain that promote brain detox. In the Blood Brain Barrier we have what are called (ABC Transporters) these regulate phase 3 detox of the CNS. Toxins in the brain would include Amyloid Beta. These transporters are what clear the brain under normal conditions; however, inflammation decreases this activity and the build up is what causes ""toxic brain"" Vitamin D can help up regulates these proteins and promote a healthier brain by increasing our detoxification capacity. 

So get out side, know your vitamin D levels and support them as needed.
Results: Would love to see some vitamin D!!!

","Jud Dean: Are the ribs bruised? Or did you strain an intercostal actually??
Todd Roselle: I think they’re brides but in not sure. Feeling better every day little buddy little.
Jud Dean: Ok buddy way to be smart
Todd Roselle: I just reread the auto correct version of what I sent back last night when I didn’t have glasses on. Wtf! Lol. 

I’m pretty sure they are bruised but when anything comes and goes like this chest thing has been doing, I of course think the worst. 

Considering it could take 6 weeks to fully heal is a little disturbing too. I know I’ve had pain in this exact spot at other times over the last 9 months or so, specifically when I’ve laid down to do push ups or the incline row (what was programmed yesterday). However, I don’t know if I had bar muscle ups near the time I had the incline row. So I just know I’ve had pain I the chest before. Again, always thinking the worst.
Jud Dean: I am home for a little next week maybe we can link up. Muscled can take that long to heal up if not resting but the auto correct was funny I could figure out what you said haha
Todd Roselle: That would be nice."

Jud Dean: In both your miss and your hit the head is too slow getting through and not getting through enough to move the bar back over your center of mass

Think if you where pushing it off your back the head is already through so it’s super easy to get locked in.

That dip drive you are getting the bar plenty high enough just when you drive down don’t forget to drive through as well that bar needs to move back over the spine!!
Todd Roselle: Makes sense. I feel like I'm a little unstable as I go up. I'll keep concentrating on the 3 points in my feet and commit to getting under the bar. First time going up to 245 since the hamstring surgery. Glad I'm getting back. I feel like I'm where I was when we started in March of 2018
Jud Dean: Yes watch it is slow motion you will see how high the bar is but they your head stays back and never gets through

focus was the hamstring and brining that up it seems to be much improved so now we can move to aerobic side of things and remove a rest day each week
Jud Dean: you will see more work in that style now from intervals to just steady state zone 2 work
monitor your hr in the zone 2 as you do it more the hr should stay the same but the watts should go up
meaning you are producing more power but its not effecting hr
Todd Roselle: Def understand.
Jud Dean: i have a game planned laid out from now until mid feb for you so we will see how it plays out I think it will bring your engine back nicely and get you some testing here on some girl names is what we are doing now to see where we sit

Todd Roselle: Everything has been good with sleep, food etc - all the metrics have been great! 
Only thing that has been off is that my stress this week has been through the roof. Lots of meetings that required me to be more involved, people have been out and I've been falling behind. It should start to calm down next week some. I have a trip planned this Friday to Sunday - going to see some buddies in Florida. We will workout while we're there.

be sure you keep 3 points of contact and even pressure.

pressure under the big toe
pressure under the pinkie toe
pressure on the heal 

and keep that pressure as long as possible 
doing that may help the knee have a little less pain

not fun or sexy but we may need some broccoli days a week that you just work hamstring and legs

We believe in bioindividuality. That means we are honoring you as a person, your unique immune system, your unique digestive system, your lifestyle, and your goals. This is why we love to get lab information for more detailed information about your type. What foods your immune system, and digestive system do the best with and then align that protocol with your goals and lifestyle. Some things however are universal truths. We all need to eat adequate amounts of vegetables. The kind of vegetables will vary depending on our bioindividuality and our lab testing, but we all need to consume them. Assess your current diet and try to get to 5-10 servings per week. A simple way to do this is to start by adding 1 serving more per week until you can get to this range. Once we get into the 5-10 serving range we can discuss going even higher on these. This is a baseline goal for optimal, we want to be getting 5-10 servings a day. 

This is not going to happen overnight if you are not a vegetable eater so take your time and we can discuss on a call which vegetables and preparation style may be best for your goals and bioindividuality.

","Jud Dean: how is the leg doing
what are your thoughts on adding some legs back in
are they just too sore from last week 
or do you want to chat about how we think the best way to start touching them again is I know you want your quads back but i dont want to over push that too soon either
Todd Roselle: I'm def ready to add some back in. What I find is that if I go below parallel with moderate weight or with a big thrust (thrusters) the inside of my knee hurts. that said, I feel like I need to do leg work again. I'm not sore anymore. I'm good and the knee doesn't hurt when walking around. Sometimes when I bike zone 2 for 45 min plus, the knee will be a little sore the next day. Just tells me I need to be mindful of that and mix it up a little.
Jud Dean: yeah do bike to stimulate but throw in the ski

we will squat to a box even for now so you can start to focus on the hams

if you are at rise

just end all workouts with light leg ext at tempo

3 sec negative single leg for 3 sets 12-15 reps

we will work in some more legs but just that light stimulus whenever at rise is good

and squats we will use the box for now and some pulls in time from blocks so more upperback focus but start to load the hams some

i am smashed tomorrow and still have 3 calls tonight but friday i have some time and will get in and make some adjustments to your program buddy. did a few workouts on it today and some adjustmetns but keep me posted so we can keep adjusting as needed!!

ps congrats on qualifing with one freaking leg!!!
Todd Roselle: Sounds great man. Thanks for checking and the adjustments. We are a far cry from where we were in 2019, but I'm def getting an itch to dial it in. I feel like I finally have a handle on what serves me (food wise) and I've been feeling great. I'm going to get up with Jen next week too!

Jud Dean: Not sure what you are doing supplement wise in term of protein amount and creatine or things like that if keeping size on is the goal. If goal is to get really good abs normally means you have to drop 10-15 lbs
Jud Dean: Getting the inflammation down in the body will def bring body wt down with it 

Definitely think on goals 

Looks/ abs 
Strengh 
Longevity 
Cognitive function 
Hormone balance 
Performance 

They all have a body structure that may look a little different but if the goal is abs and longevity for example and get inflammation down then body wt is surly going to drop some. 

If looking to keep it up some creatine pre and post workout will help force some nutrients into the muscle belly and keep you fuller in muscle spaces


Free to chat if you desire my man 


And leg training is a player for sure legs release much more testosterone and you carry more size in lower half
Todd Roselle: It's funny, just looked at a before and after that Katie and I did. Today versus September. My chest def had more volume back then but I'm def leaner and my mobility, even in the pictures, looks better. Inflammation is down. Supplement wise, no creatine and no shakes right now. I do want to get the abs to come in and feel good. Def want to stay strong and keep pushing on gaining stamina. I may pop a time in the calendar sometime soon. 

What's your thought on adding a testosterone supplement?
Todd Roselle: Or if you would just prefer to talk that's cool too.
Jud Dean: Want kind of test supplement I can help guide but if goal is having another kid that will surely make having a kid much harder as test supplements lower sperm production and count. But we can chat about it and u can share what supplements you may be considering"

Todd Roselle: Inflammation is down. I feel the bruising down in my calf now and some fluid retention. Going to go see my Ortho when I get back. Almost positive it’s an interior meniscus tear based on how it feels now and all the symptoms. Def fee better than last Monday but running, jumping squatting etc is still no go. Concentrating on stability now and trying not to mess it up! :)

Considering we’re away, food has been pretty good.

we all desire to improve our health or we would not be doing this.

but we all have a different why.

so what is your why

dont just ask this once
ask it 5 times below is an example from me

Q: why do i want to coach and educate clients and patients 

I want to help people

Q: why

Because my father passed away to young

Q: Why does that motivate you to help people

Because i dont want them to pass away to young and miss time with their family and loved ones by making poor health choices

Q: Why dont you want that for them why does that motivate you

I wish i had my father around during tough parts of my life and still wish i had him here today for advice or to play with my son.

Q why does that make you a better coach 

I see my father in most of my clients and its a chance for me to help them since i could not help him.

* do you see how you have to keep going into the next layer and next layer keep asking why

there is more to your why then i just want to look good or i want to be healthy

when you find those deeper whys you will not give up so easy on the changes you will have to make to really see progress and improve your health!

we all desire to improve our health or we would not be doing this.

but we all have a different why.

so what is your why

dont just ask this once
ask it 5 times below is an example from me

Q: why do i want to coach

I want to help people

Q: why

Because my father passed away to young

Q: Why does that motivate you to help people

Because i dont want them to pass away to young and miss time with their family and loved ones by making poor health choices

Q: Why dont you want that for them why does that motivate you

I wish i had my father around during tough parts of my life and still wish i had him here today for advice or to play with my son.

Q why does that make you a better coach 

I see my father in most of my clients and its a chance for me to help them since i could not help him.

* do you see how you have to keep going into the next layer and next layer keep asking why

there is more to your why then i just want to look good or i want to be healthy

when you find those deeper whys you will not give up so easy on the changes you will have to make to really see progress and improve your health!

","Jud Dean: Strong 

How is the leg feeling going knee to pits 

U feeling better on that range of motion 

Has the doc given you any guidelines 

I know you are way ahead of schedule but wondering their thoughts if you go for a check in with them at any point 

Thoughts on prp
Todd Roselle: Knee to pits is good - no pain. 
The range of motion is more constrained when I'm trying to do things with a straight leg (and bring it up) as opposed to bending to a full squat - that motion is coming along nicely. The hamstring was tightly re attached under my glute, which is causing the other connection point by my knee to be very tight and strained.
Funny you ask about going back to see him. As the recovery has progressed this week, i was thinking the same thing. Might be a good idea to get his feedback at this point on what I should do to continue the rehab.

My thought is that i need mobility because the area that is now the most challenging is not at the surgery site, but rather on the other end. The surgery site is obviously not healed completely but I do believe we're well on our way there. 

I think i should schedule with him for sure. thanks for checking in. Glad to see we're on the same wave length.
Jud Dean: def same page 
we need to know his take and ways to speed up the recovery
i would def suggest the voodoo band mobility work on the hamstring daily even just at desk to loosen that up
Todd Roselle: Ok, sounds good. I'll see if i can get in w him the week after next when im' back up north.

Will be in Rehob until Monday the 27th, then in Mtown on Tuesday and Wednesday the 28th and 29th. Back south again on the 30th.

Any chance I could come to your gym on Tuesday this week?

Todd Roselle: Glad I used the 20lb wb. Food is ok. I'm good when we don't have company. So far it's been basically 4 days are clean and 3 aren't. Not a good ratio, but i do my best when we're out and about. Alcohol has been limited when i do drink, try to only have 1 or less. I'm average about 1 day/wk where I have more than 1 and 2 days where i'll have 1. I'd like to get that knocked back because I feel like the workouts are getting better.

"Friday, June 26th, 2020",Completed,TESTING LACTIC WORK,"A LACTIC TESTING A:
THE FOCUS: record the score but the score is not the focus
the focus is going hard 97% hard effort
and putting a lot of power into the physical challenge so we establish where the anerobic system. 

30 seconds of kb swing ( not heavy dont want to much on the hamstring but i want it to work a little) if t his botherse it switch to a db push press
30 sec burpee
30 sec bike for cals
rest 7 mins between sets
x 3 sets
Results: Burpee was tough because I can’t bend my leg during the burpee like normal, I have full mobility into a squat but when moving for a burpee there is pressure in areas that are different from a squat - was forced to stay straight legged through most of the burpee motion which slowed me down. All things considered here are the scores:

1 - 14 swings (53)/12 burpee/ 10 cals 
2 - 15/11/9 
3 - 14/10/11

B after set 3 rest for 10 mins:

Results: Done

C lactic test B:
THE FOCUS: record the score but the score is not the focus
the focus is going hard 97% hard effort
and putting a lot of power into the physical challenge so we establish where the anerobic system. 

30 sec of db thrusters a wt u can stay unbroken but not super light or super heavy maybe like 35-50lbs depending on how the leg feels
30 sec burpee over the db so a lateral jump 
30 sec bike for cals 
rest 7 mins between sets
x 3 sets
Results: Thruster was at 40 lbs. I felt a little off (meaning balance wasn’t equal between my legs) through all. Not much, just a little.

Or if I stay in the same area, like I have been with the dead big press, hand braced row, anti rotational row and v ups that’s fine because I was in the same area. They’re worried about the spread.

feel what is something that will give you 30 sec very very hard effort 100% range but at 32secons its totally game over
then do 5 sets of this pace for 30 seconds
rest 4 mins walking!!!
really get after those 30 seconds making 31 secons not possbile!
Results: Ouch. These were really tough. I stopped after the warm up sets and 2 actual sets. I wasn’t recovered after the 30 sec push and couldn’t get back to where I thought I could hold for 30 sec on subsequent sets. 

After warm up I thought I could hold between 85/90 rpm. First actual set was about 88, second set was 80 but died at the 20 sec Mark. 

I didn’t feel like I would be able to keep it at a high level so I stopped after 2. 

Ouch!!!! Aerobic capacity and handling the burn needs work

C cool down with 15-20 mins easy cardio of choice:

Results: Yes

","Jud Dean: Yes call it just like you did if not you threshold train to far and it ends up bad connection 

So we will redo and start lower rpm and build to this goal over time
Todd Roselle: Sounds good. Interesting feedback. I felt a little zonked yesterday after the workout. The weights were tough too. With that said, my workout today felt really strong after a good night's sleep. Just wanted to provide the feedback.
Jud Dean: Yes the feedback is so hepful to see where we are and where we want to go buddy fantastic sleep is so big man you guys have an awesome weekend"

I know you mentioned that there were some secrets/plans you had that may help me as I get ready to go to Hawaii, I'm ready for the last minute secret sauce plan!

Warm Up
This workout requires a great deal of hip and prep so take your time but dont exhaust yourself in prep. get hot get loose get some touches and get to work!
You can scale the warm-up repetitions and volume based on your personal ability and needs.
A. General Prep to get hot this it break a sweat...its colder this weekend you may way to keep a hoodie on during this to get a hot and core temp up
15 min @ warm up pace: 250m Row
10 KBS @ 35/53#
10 Alt Step Up @ 24/20” 
10 Burpees
20 DU’s or 50 singles depending on effort if not great at doubles dont waste the energy trying for them the key is jumping and getting flow 

General preparation work is meant to get the body moving and blood flowing. When blood is flowing to your muscles, those muscles are better able to receive the oxygen and other resources they need to contract and perform so be sure you are hot after this first part of the general prep team!!!


B. Dynamic Prep
Scap Preparation : this can be some bear crawls or a wall walk or 2
hip preparation: this can be leg swings or happy hip series to get the glutes active
Lacrosse ball: Lats / Pecs / Triceps glutes rolling out

Bending (*NEED to get hamstrings and glutes turned on and working)
Single Leg Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift; 5/leg SLOW (Dumbbell in opposite hand; move through hip) x 2 sets superset with single leg glute bridge if doing pistols or hips tend to be tight 5 reps per side 
- Double Kettlebell Front Rack Carry; 100' tough x 2 sets (elbows down and working on breathing while bracing) core activation here get belly ready to brace...feel ribs down locked and braced while breathing over a brace 

C. strengh prep for cns 
Squat Clean and Split/Push Jerk - Build to a moderately tough single in less than 15 min
*If you are going to power clean, then warm that up. You should build up to roughly 78-84% of your current 1RM. This will ensure the brain is ready for the heavier loads.


D. Specific Prep
3 sets @ increasing pace: 15 Cal Row
6 BJSD
6 CnJ
4 Alt Pistols or age group movement
3 CnJ
-2 min rest-
*increase loads each set

ring muscle ups
Results: 4:30 - Learned to maintain form, even when the weights are lighter.  Don't just rip it.  My left arm was a bit sore after due to me not pulling equally and not pulling with my body, I pulled with my arms.  Good news - weights felt light.  Bad news - I would have screwed myself if i had other workouts for time that day.  Changing the weights is what slowed me down the most.

as soon as a movement is done though you hold your breath for as long as possible before the 5 big breaths (going hypoxic)
Results: This one was interesting - 
Held my breath after the 400 and felt a release of painful shit after I finally took a breath. Lactic acid was showing up about 1/2 way through the 400 row.  I ate my broccoli.

","Todd Roselle: From katie: 

I’ve been taking it easy. Today was the first time working out since last weekend at rise.
The neck pain is more in the top area of my spine and behind my right shoulder. The sharp nerve pain is gone.

I took prednisone for 6 days and the inflammation went away so pain decreased. 

I haven’t been drinking. My food is on point and clean this week. So I was feeling like a 2/10 with pain this week however it’s constantly aching so I’m kind of living with it (its become the norm..) And nights are worse than mornings. 

Today I’m a 5/10 with pain. In the neck area and right shoulder area. Haven’t taken any Aleve, just going to ice. 

It’s painful to extend my right arm straight up over the head with weight and painful when I lean on it. 

Left side I’m good. 

Down for whatever workouts I can do! Especially to keep things tight if possible. I’m noticing less muscle tone in my arms lol! No!!!! 

Lastly, Scheduling my MRI today. 
If you need more info, let me know. 

Thank you for all you do!!
Jud Dean: KEEP ME POSTED ON THE MRI AND AS I SPOKE WITH TODD HE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR FALL BESURE TO TELL THEM ABOUT THAT. THAT KIND OF WHIPLASH EFFECT CAN EXPRESS LATER ON AS WELL WHEN IMMFLAMATION IS PRESENT. SO HOPEFULLY THE MRI IS GOOD RESULTS OR AT WORST WE GET A PLAN TO HEAL. PRP IS A GREAT OPTION I KNOW WORKS WELL I ALWAYS SUGGEST AND REFER TO ADAM MADAY IN DOVER AND KALMAN IN WILMINGTON ONE IS CHIRO ART WORK THE OTHER IS AN ORTHO THEY WORK WELL TOGETHER. LOTS WE CAN DO WITH NEW EQUIPMENT IN THE GYM TO IMPROVE THE BODY STILL AND STAY HEALTHY AND SMART. SOME TRACTION ON THE NECK IS MOST LIKELY A GOOD IDEA THEY MAKE DEVICES LIKE THE NECK HAMMOCK AND MORE INTENSE TRACTION DEVICES TO BRING HOME SOME OF WHICH INSURANCE WILL COVER BUT I WOULD CONSULT DOC MADAY OR KALMAN PRIOR TO THAT HOME CARE."

Jud Dean: are you butterfly on them or normal kip
Todd Roselle: The bicep was still sore this morning (Saturday). The elbow was sore yesterday as well. I’m not sure what it’s from. Whether it was the toes to bar or the cable row, or the strict pull ups. Not sure. 

This week I didn’t do any butterfly or kip. When I started to do the ctb yesterday I tried kip. Did the first two and the bicep and elbow were too uncomfortable.
Jud Dean: Ok we will work the parts and leave it be for a little longer test other parts
Jud Dean: studying your program design tonight for flare ups....i think we may need to leave all bicep training out even though it will help strengthen the elbow joint it also could be a reason why the bicep flared on these. i am going to take the bicep work out fully and rebuild then try CTB again and see if it feeels better"
